**ðŸšœ Under Active Construction (not finished yet)**

Sometimes finding the right css units can be a pain. This tool will help you to figure out the right css units for your project. Figure out your CSS unit with ease. All you need to do is just answer some questions.

This project is highly inspired by [whatunit.com](https://whatunit.com/). Check the awesome flowchart there.

This project is created from this awesome [sveltekit starter template](https://github.com/shamscorner/sveltekit-stackter)

## TODOs

- [x] Font size
- [x] Spacing
- [x] Positioning
- [x] Details/effects
- [x] Flex or grid
- [ ] Width or height on an element

## Run on your local?

Rename `.env-example` to `.env` or `.env.local`

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
